* MWRA-export
The [[https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm][MWRA Wastewater COVID-19 Tracking project]] is an insanely good data source for
SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the metro Boston environment.

However, the static graphs aren't very easy to read, and the raw data link given at
the bottom of the page is a PDF.

This tool provides a simple utility that takes the raw data PDF, extracts the numbers
in it, and saves them as a CSV for further analysis.
** What's next?
I might add plotting functionality with ~seaborn~ or ~plotnine~.  PRs welcome.
